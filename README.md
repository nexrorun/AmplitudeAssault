# What Even Is This Game?

Amplitude Assault is a bullet hell game set to music. Here's the basic idea:

1. Music plays
2. The music creates projectiles and enemies
3. You dodge them
4. You try not to die before the song ends

That's it. That's the game. But oh, there's so much more to understand about HOW you do all of that. Let's get into it.

You play as a small geometric shape (you can pick which one later), and your job is to survive. Projectiles will fly at you from all directions, synced to whatever song is playing. Bass-heavy parts of the song create big, explosive projectiles. High-pitched treble sections create rapid-fire attacks. The music literally tries to kill you.

Your goal? Make it to the end of the song with health remaining. Sounds simple. It is not.

---

# Starting The Game - The Loading Screen

When you first open Amplitude Assault, you'll see a **Loading Screen**. Here's what happens:

1. A **spinning loader animation** appears in the center of your screen. It has a nice cyan glow to it. Very pretty.

2. Below the spinner, you'll see **status messages** that tell you what's happening. The first one you'll typically see says "Initializing audio system" - the game is getting its sound engine ready.

3. While you wait, **Loading Tips** may appear. These are little hints about the game to keep you entertained during the load.

4. You don't need to click anything. The game will **automatically transition** to the Main Menu once everything is loaded.

That's it for the loading screen. Just wait. It won't take long.

---

# The Main Menu - Your Home Base

Once loading completes, you arrive at the **Main Menu**. This is your central hub for everything. Let me describe exactly what you're looking at.

## The Background

Behind everything, you'll notice the game is actually running a **demo in the background**. You can see the game's checkerboard grid, glowing and pulsing to some menu music. It's like a screensaver showing off what gameplay looks like. If you have "Show Player" enabled (more on that later), you might even see your character avatar floating around in the demo.

## The Left Sidebar Panel

On the **left side of your screen**, there's a semi-transparent dark panel. This is your main menu. It slides in and contains all your navigation options. Let me break down every single thing on this panel, from top to bottom:

### The Game Title

Right at the top, you'll see **"AMPLITUDE ASSAULT"** written in big, glowing letters. The title has a cool floating animation - it gently bobs up and down. It looks alive. It's just there to look cool. You can't click it.

### Your Profile Information

Just below the title, you'll see your **player level and XP**. It will say something like:

> **LVL 1**
> **EXP 0 / 1000**

This shows your progression. As you play songs and score points, you earn XP. Every 1000 XP, you level up. Leveling up unlocks new character skins (we'll get to that). Your level goes from 1 to 50.

---

# Understanding The Menu Sections

The menu is divided into collapsible sections. You can click on the section headers to expand or collapse them. Here's each section explained in excruciating detail:

## The "GAME" Section

This section contains everything related to actually playing the game. It has a header that says **"GAME"** (or similar), and when expanded, you'll see these buttons:

### "CHOOSE YOUR SONG" Button

This is a big button, probably the first one you'll notice. When you click it:

1. Your computer's **file browser** opens up
2. You can navigate to any audio file on your computer
3. Select an MP3, WAV, OGG, or other audio file
4. Click "Open" or "Select"

The game will then load your song and prepare it for gameplay. Once loaded, you'll see a preview of the song and can click PLAY to start the level.

This is how you play with your own music - literally any song you have on your device.

### "CAREER MODE" Button

Click this to open the **Career Mode Modal** - a popup window with story missions. Career Mode is the structured, narrative experience with preset songs and an actual plot. More details in the Career Mode section below.

### "TUTORIAL" Button

Click this and the game will generate a gentle, 60-second tutorial level. It's designed to teach you the basics without being too punishing. Perfect for your first time playing.

### "PLAY" Button

This button starts the game with whatever song you've selected. **Important:** This button is grayed out and unclickable until you've actually selected a song (either through "Choose Your Song" or Career Mode). Once you have a song ready, it lights up and becomes clickable.

---

## The "CUSTOMIZE" Section

This section is all about making the game your own. Expand it to see:

### "Lore Book" Button

Click this to open the **Lore Book Modal**. This is where the game's story lives. You can read all about the narrative (something about a virus in an audio mainframe, you as an antivirus construct, very dramatic stuff). There's also an **Entity Database** that describes every enemy type in the game. If you're into lore, this is your spot.

### "Garage" Button

Click this to open the **Garage Modal** - the character skin selection screen. Here you can see all the different player avatars you can use, which ones you've unlocked, and which ones are still locked. Select a skin to use it. More details in the Garage section below.

### "Menu Music Volume" Slider

This is a slider that goes from **0% to 100%**. Drag it left to lower the volume of the music playing in the menu background. Drag it right to make it louder. This only affects menu music - not gameplay audio.

### "Show Player" Checkbox

A small checkbox. When **checked**, your player avatar will appear in the background demo playing behind the menu. When **unchecked**, the demo runs without showing a player character. This is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect actual gameplay.

### "Deadly Mode" Checkbox

This is important. When you **check this box**, you enable **Deadly Mode**. In Deadly Mode:

- You die in **one hit**
- There are **no checkpoints** - you cannot respawn mid-song
- The game throws **more projectiles** at you
- It's brutal

Leave this unchecked if you want a normal, survivable experience. Check it if you want to suffer.

### "Graphics Quality" Dropdown

Click this to reveal a dropdown menu with graphics options:

- **ULTRA** - Maximum visual effects. Bloom, intense glows, particles everywhere. Looks gorgeous but might lag on slower devices.
- **HIGH** - All effects enabled, glowing elements, motion trails, particles. The intended experience.
- **MEDIUM** - Reduced glow, no particles. Still has motion trails. Smoother performance.
- **BASIC** - Minimal effects. Best performance for older devices.

Changes apply immediately. Pick whatever runs smoothly on your device.

### "Offline Info" Button

Click this to open a modal explaining how to **download the game for offline play**. The game can be saved as a single file and played without internet. The modal shows download buttons and instructions for different platforms.

---

# Career Mode - The Story Experience

When you click the **Career Mode** button, a modal (popup window) appears. Let me walk you through every element of this screen.

## The Career Mode Modal

This popup shows you a list of **story missions** you can play. Here's what you'll see:

### The Mission List

There are **4 main missions** plus **1 final boss mission** that unlocks after completing all others. Each mission is displayed as a clickable card showing:

1. **Song Name** - The title of the track for this mission (e.g., "Digital Masquerade", "Dizzy Carousel", etc.)

2. **Difficulty Badge** - A colored badge showing how hard this mission is:
   - **EASY** - Green badge. Gentle introduction.
   - **MEDIUM** - Orange badge. Getting tougher.
   - **HARD** - Pink badge. Challenging.
   - **CHALLENGER** - Magenta badge. Very difficult.
   - **EXPERT++** - White badge. The final boss. Maximum difficulty.

3. **Story Text** - A brief snippet of the narrative for this mission. Something dramatic about corrupted systems and virus threats.

### Locked Missions

The final mission (**"Mutant"**) is locked until you complete all previous missions. It will appear grayed out or with a lock icon. Beat the other four missions first.

### Selecting a Mission

Click on any mission card to select it. This opens the **Level Preview Modal** (described in detail below) where you can see more info about the song and click PLAY to start.

### The Close Button

In the corner of the modal (usually top-right), there's a **red X button** or "Close" button. Click it to close the Career Mode modal and return to the main menu.

### Save Slots

Career Mode has **3 save slots**. Each slot can have:
- Its own **difficulty setting** (Easy, Medium, or Hard)
- Its own **completion progress**
- Independent tracking of which missions you've beaten

You can switch between slots to play at different difficulty levels without losing progress.

---

# Tutorial Mode - Learning The Ropes

If you click the **Tutorial** button in the main menu, here's what happens:

1. The game generates a **60-second tutorial song** automatically
2. A gentle, forgiving level is created
3. Projectiles come slowly and predictably
4. You get to practice moving and dodging without intense pressure

The tutorial is perfect for:
- First-time players
- Learning the controls
- Getting comfortable with how movement feels
- Understanding what projectiles look like

There's no story in the tutorial. It's just practice. Once the 60 seconds are up, you'll see the victory screen and can return to the menu.

---

# Custom Songs - Bring Your Own Music

One of the coolest features of Amplitude Assault is the ability to play with **your own music**. Here's exactly how to do it:

## Step 1: Click "Choose Your Song"

In the main menu's GAME section, click the **"Choose Your Song"** button.

## Step 2: Find Your Audio File

Your computer's file browser opens. Navigate to wherever you keep your music. Find an audio file you want to play to. Supported formats include:
- MP3
- WAV
- OGG
- And most other common audio formats

## Step 3: Select the File

Click on the file, then click "Open" (or double-click the file).

## Step 4: Wait for Processing

The game needs a moment to analyze your song. It looks at the audio frequencies to figure out how to generate the level. A loading indicator may appear briefly.

## Step 5: Preview Your Level

Once processing completes, the **Level Preview Modal** appears (described in detail below). You can see the song title, its automatically-assigned difficulty, and even preview what the gameplay will look like.

## Step 6: Click PLAY

Hit the big PLAY button and the game begins with your song.

## Important Notes About Custom Songs

- **Everything happens locally** - Your audio file is not uploaded anywhere. All analysis happens on your device.
- **Any song works** - The game can generate a level from literally any audio. Classical, metal, electronic, podcasts, whatever.
- **Difficulty varies** - Intense songs with lots of bass and treble will create harder levels. Mellow songs create easier ones.
- **Song length matters** - Longer songs mean longer survival sessions.

---

# The Level Preview Screen

Whenever you're about to play a song (whether from Career Mode or Custom Songs), you'll see the **Level Preview Modal**. Here's everything on this screen:

## Album Art Area

A dark square or rectangle showing album art (if available) or a placeholder. This is just decorative.

## Song Title

The name of the song you're about to play, displayed prominently.

## Difficulty Badge

A colored badge showing the difficulty rating:
- **EASY** (green)
- **MEDIUM** (orange)
- **HARD** (pink)
- **CHALLENGER** (magenta)
- **EXPERT++** (white)

For custom songs, this is calculated automatically based on the song's audio properties.

## Difficulty Explanation

A brief text explanation of what this difficulty means. Something like "Standard challenge - test your skills" for MEDIUM, or "Extreme intensity - for experts only" for EXPERT++.

## Song Description / Story

For Career Mode missions, this shows story text explaining the narrative context. For custom songs, this might be blank or show generic text.

## Preview Volume Slider

A slider letting you adjust the volume of the preview audio. Goes from 0% to 100%. This only affects the preview - not actual gameplay volume.

## Animated Preview

Behind the modal or in a dedicated area, you'll see an **animated preview** of what gameplay looks like. The background grid pulses, projectiles fly around (in demo mode), giving you a taste of what's coming.

## The PLAY Button

A big, usually pink/magenta button that says **"PLAY"**. Click this to start the level. There will be a brief countdown (3... 2... 1...) and then the song and gameplay begin.

## The BACK Button

A gray button that takes you back to the previous screen (either the main menu or the Career Mode modal). Click this if you change your mind and don't want to play this song right now.

---

# The Countdown - Get Ready

After clicking PLAY, but before the actual gameplay starts, you'll see a **Countdown Screen**.

## What You'll See

- Large numbers appear in the center of the screen: **3... 2... 1...**
- Each number displays for about one second
- The background might start to pulse gently
- You have a moment to position your cursor where you want to start

## What To Do During the Countdown

- **Move your cursor** (or controller stick) to position your character
- **Take a breath** - you're about to need focus
- The countdown fades away and gameplay immediately begins
- The music starts right as the countdown ends

---

# Actually Playing The Game

Okay, the countdown is done. The song is playing. Here's what's happening and what you need to do.

## Your Character

You control a **small geometric shape** somewhere on screen. It glows. It has a trail of light behind it when you move. This is you. Don't let things hit it.

## How Movement Works

Your character **follows your cursor** (or controller input). It doesn't teleport - it moves smoothly toward wherever you're pointing. The movement is fluid and feels responsive. Here's the key:

- **Move your cursor** → Your character moves toward that spot
- **Keep moving** → You'll have a glowing motion trail showing your path
- **Stop moving** → Your character stops (no momentum, thankfully)

## Your Objective

**Don't get hit by projectiles. Survive until the song ends.**

That's literally it. The song will play from start to finish. Projectiles spawn in patterns synced to the music. You dodge. If you still have health when the song ends, you win.

## What Shoots At You

Projectiles spawn from the edges of the screen, or sometimes from enemies/bosses. They come in various patterns:
- Some fly straight across
- Some spiral outward
- Some track your position
- Some sweep in lines with gaps
- Some are massive laser beams

We'll cover all projectile types in detail in their own section below.

## The Flow of Gameplay

1. Song starts playing
2. Projectiles begin spawning, synced to the music
3. Intensity builds as the song progresses
4. Particularly intense sections of the music create particularly intense attacks
5. Boss might spawn during climactic moments
6. Song ends
7. If you're alive, you win

---

# The HUD - What All Those Numbers Mean

During gameplay, you'll see various displays around the edges of your screen. This is the **HUD** (Heads-Up Display). Let's go through every single element.

## Top-Left Corner

This is where most of your important info lives.

### SCORE (Cyan Text)

Your current **score**. This number increases as you dodge projectiles, maintain combos, and perform well. The higher, the better. Watch it climb during intense sections.

### COMBO (Yellow Text)

Your current **combo counter**. This appears once you've dodged 5 consecutive projectiles without getting hit. It shows a number (like "COMBO 23") indicating your streak. The text is animated - it pops in and shakes when the combo increases.

**Note:** The combo display is **hidden** until you reach 5 combo. Below 5, you won't see it.

### COMBO METER (Colored Bar)

A visual bar that **fills up** as your combo grows. The bar changes color as your combo increases:
- **Yellow** at the start
- **Cyan** as it grows
- **Orange** for higher combos
- **Purple** for massive combos

When the bar fills up, your score multiplier increases.

### GRAZE (Amber Text)

Your **graze counter**. A "graze" happens when a projectile passes **very close** to you without actually hitting you. It's a near-miss. The game rewards these with bonus points. This counter shows how many grazes you've achieved.

### TIME (Yellow Text)

The **elapsed time** in seconds since the song started. Useful for knowing how far into the song you are.

### LEVEL (Pink Text)

Your **player level** (from your profile). This is the same level that shows in the main menu. It ranges from 1 to 50. Higher levels might subtly affect your hitbox size or score multipliers (making graze windows slightly more forgiving at higher levels).

### DEADLY MODE INDICATOR (Red Text)

If you have Deadly Mode enabled, you'll see a **red indicator** somewhere on the HUD reminding you that one hit means death. If Deadly Mode is off, this indicator doesn't appear.

### HEALTH BAR (Top-Left Area)

A **green gradient bar** showing your remaining health. When full, it's a solid green. As you take damage, it depletes from right to left. When it gets low:
- The bar might pulse or glow to warn you
- Colors might shift toward yellow or red
- You need to be extra careful

## Song Progress Bar

Usually at the bottom or top of the screen, there's a **progress bar** showing how far through the song you are.
- It's colored **cyan** (or similar)
- Has a **pulsing head** at the current position
- Reaches 100% when the song is about to end

This is crucial for knowing "how much more do I need to survive?"

---

# Understanding Your Health

Let's talk about health in more detail because it's kind of important for, you know, not dying.

## The Health Bar

Your health is displayed as a bar in the top-left corner. It's usually a nice **green gradient** color when full.

## Taking Damage

When a projectile hits you:
1. Your health bar **decreases**
2. Your character **flashes white** briefly (hit animation)
3. Your combo **resets** (if you had one)
4. There might be a brief moment of invincibility after the hit

## How Much Damage?

Different projectiles might deal different amounts of damage, but generally, you can take multiple hits before dying (unless you're in Deadly Mode, where one hit = death).

## Healing

There is **no healing** in this game. Once you lose health, it's gone until the song ends or you respawn at a checkpoint.

## Death

When your health bar empties completely:
1. Your character **cracks** visually
2. Then **shatters into fragments** (death animation takes about 2 seconds)
3. The game pauses briefly
4. What happens next depends on checkpoints and whether you're in Deadly Mode

---

# The Combo System

Combos are a huge part of scoring in Amplitude Assault. Let me explain exactly how they work.

## Building a Combo

Every time you **successfully dodge** a projectile (it passes by without hitting you), your combo counter increases by 1.

## The Combo Display

Once your combo reaches **5**, the combo counter appears on your HUD. It shows:
- The word "COMBO"
- Your current combo number (like "15" or "42")
- An animation - the counter pops in with a bounce
- The counter **shakes** each time it increases

## The Combo Meter

As your combo grows, a visual **meter fills up**. Think of it like an XP bar for your combo. When the meter fills:
- You gain a **score multiplier** boost
- The meter resets and starts filling again
- The meter color changes (yellow → cyan → orange → purple) at higher combos

## Score Multipliers

Your combo affects how many points you earn:
- **5 combo** = 1x multiplier (base)
- **10 combo** = 2x multiplier
- **Higher combos** = up to **5x multiplier**

So if an action normally gives 100 points, at 5x multiplier you get 500 points. Maintaining high combos is key to high scores.

## Breaking Your Combo

Your combo **resets to 0** if:
- You get **hit by a projectile**
- You go **too long without dodging** anything (like during a quiet section of music)

When your combo breaks, the combo display disappears (until you build it back up to 5).

## The Graze Bonus

A **graze** is a near-miss. When a projectile passes extremely close to you without hitting, you get:
- Extra points
- Your graze counter increases
- A small score bonus

Grazes are risky but rewarding. Advanced players intentionally graze projectiles to maximize score.

---

# Scoring Points

Let's break down exactly how you earn points.

## Points From Dodging

The primary source of points. Each projectile you successfully dodge (that would have hit you if you hadn't moved) earns points. More dangerous projectiles = more points.

## Points From Combos

Your combo multiplier applies to points earned:
- Low combo = base points
- High combo = multiplied points (up to 5x)

Keeping your combo going is essential for high scores.

## Points From Grazing

Near-misses give bonus points. The closer the call, the more points. This rewards precise, risky play.

## Points From Survival

Just surviving earns points. The longer you last, the more your base score grows.

## Final Score

When the song ends (and you're alive), your final score is displayed on the victory screen. It's the sum of all points earned throughout the song.

---

# The Different Types of Projectiles Trying to Kill You

There are many types of attacks in Amplitude Assault. Let me describe each one so you know what you're dealing with.

## Shards

**Appearance:** Small, bright diamond shapes with a glow around them.

**Behavior:** They fly in a **straight line** at fast speed. They spawn from screen edges and cross to the other side.

**How to Dodge:** Watch their trajectory. They don't change direction, so just don't be in their path.

**Spawn Trigger:** Usually synced to treble/high-frequency parts of the music.

---

## Spirals

**Appearance:** Slow-moving orbs with a trailing effect behind them.

**Behavior:** They move outward in **expanding spiral patterns**. They start from a center point and circle outward, gradually covering more of the screen.

**How to Dodge:** Move through the gaps between spiral arms. Pay attention to the rotation direction.

**Spawn Trigger:** Often appear during sustained notes or atmospheric sections.

---

## Sweepers

**Appearance:** Horizontal or vertical **lines of projectiles** that move across the screen.

**Behavior:** They sweep from one side to the other, but have **gaps** in them that you can fit through.

**How to Dodge:** Identify the gap in the line and move to it before the sweeper passes through your position.

**Spawn Trigger:** Often during rhythmic, repetitive sections of music.

---

## Lasers

**Appearance:** Start as a **dashed line** (warning phase), then become a **solid beam** (damage phase).

**Behavior:**
1. A dashed line appears across part of the screen
2. You have a moment to see where it will be
3. The line becomes solid and deals damage to anything touching it
4. It stays active for a moment, then disappears

**How to Dodge:** When you see the dashed warning line, move away from that path immediately. You have a brief window before it activates.

**Spawn Trigger:** Usually on powerful beats or dramatic music moments.

---

## Rockets

**Appearance:** Large, chunky projectiles. Much bigger than shards.

**Behavior:**
1. They spawn and **move slowly** at first
2. They have a **lock-on indicator** that tracks your position
3. After a moment of tracking, they **sprint** toward your current position at high speed

**How to Dodge:** Keep moving. When you see a rocket, note where it's aiming. Right before it sprints, change direction sharply. It will rocket toward where you *were*, not where you are.

**Spawn Trigger:** Bass-heavy moments, drops, or intense sections.

---

## Shockwaves

**Appearance:** **Expanding rings** of projectiles that grow outward from a center point.

**Behavior:** A ring of projectiles expands outward in all directions. Sometimes multiple rings come in succession.

**How to Dodge:** Find a gap in the ring and move through it as it expands past you. Or move toward the center if you can get there before the wave reaches you.

**Spawn Trigger:** Major impacts in the music, like drum hits or bass drops.

---

## Slams

**Appearance:** Large **impact zones** marked on the ground/screen.

**Behavior:**
1. A warning indicator shows where the slam will hit
2. After a brief delay, the slam occurs
3. Anything in the impact zone takes damage

**How to Dodge:** When you see the impact zone marker, move out of it. You usually have 1-2 seconds of warning.

**Spawn Trigger:** Boss attacks, heavy bass, climactic moments.

---

# Boss Fights

Sometimes during gameplay, a **Boss** appears. Here's everything you need to know.

## When Do Bosses Appear?

- **Career Mode:** The final mission ("Mutant") is a dedicated boss fight. Other career missions may have boss segments.
- **Custom Songs:** Bosses can spawn during intense sections of any song. The game detects high-intensity audio and triggers boss spawns.

## Boss Appearance

The boss is a **large entity** that appears on screen. It's much bigger than regular projectiles. It has a **wrap effect** around it - a semi-transparent circle highlighting its presence so you can always see it.

## Boss Movement

The boss **moves around the screen** with aggressive, drifting patterns. It tracks toward your position but doesn't chase you instantly - it slides and drifts.

## Boss Attacks

Bosses cycle through multiple attack patterns:

### Radial Bursts
The boss fires projectiles in **all directions** at once. You need to find gaps between the projectile paths.

### Spiral Formations
The boss creates **spiral patterns** of projectiles that rotate outward. Navigate between the spiral arms.

### Rocket Barrages
Multiple rockets spawn, all targeting you. Keep moving to avoid the sprinting rockets.

### Fan Patterns
A **wide spread** of projectiles in a fan shape. Move to the side to avoid the fan's range.

### Shockwave Rings
Expanding rings come from the boss. Find gaps and weave through.

### Slam Attacks
The boss marks ground zones and slams them. Stay out of marked areas.

## Boss Phases

Bosses often have **multiple phases**:
- **Phase 1:** Standard attack patterns
- **Phase 2:** More aggressive, faster attacks, new patterns added

Visual changes indicate phase transitions - the boss might glow differently or move faster.

## Defeating the Boss

You don't "damage" the boss in the traditional sense. You survive. Once the intense section of music passes (or the career mission ends), the boss fight concludes.

For the final "Mutant" boss in Career Mode, completing the fight triggers a special **ending cutscene**.

---

# Dying and Checkpoints

Let's talk about what happens when things go wrong.

## The Death Sequence

When your health reaches 0:

1. **Crack Animation:** Your character sprite begins to crack, fracture lines appearing across it
2. **Shatter Animation:** The character breaks apart into fragments that scatter
3. **Pause:** The game freezes briefly (about 2 seconds) to show the death
4. **What's Next:** Depends on checkpoints and game mode

## Checkpoints (Normal Mode)

In **normal mode** (Deadly Mode OFF), the game has a **checkpoint system**:

- Checkpoints are placed automatically during gameplay at certain safe moments
- When you die, if you've passed a checkpoint, you **respawn there**
- Upon respawning:
  - All active hazards clear from the screen
  - Your health restores to full
  - The song rewinds to the checkpoint time
  - A brief countdown happens before resuming
  - Your score and combo from before death are preserved (combo resets though)

This means you can retry difficult sections without restarting the entire song.

## No Checkpoints Reached

If you die before reaching any checkpoint:
- Game Over screen appears
- You'll need to retry the song from the beginning

## Deadly Mode (No Checkpoints)

In **Deadly Mode**:
- **One hit** = instant death
- Checkpoints are **disabled**
- When you die, it's immediately Game Over
- You must restart from the beginning

---

# Deadly Mode - For The Brave

Deadly Mode is an optional challenge mode that significantly increases difficulty.

## How to Enable Deadly Mode

In the main menu, under the CUSTOMIZE section, there's a checkbox labeled **"Deadly Mode"**. Check this box to enable it.

## What Changes in Deadly Mode

1. **One-Hit Death:** Any single hit kills you instantly. Your health bar is effectively meaningless.

2. **No Checkpoints:** You cannot respawn mid-song. Death means starting over.

3. **Increased Projectile Density:** The game spawns more projectiles, more frequently. Patterns are denser.

4. **Visual Indicator:** A red indicator on the HUD reminds you that Deadly Mode is active.

## Who Is Deadly Mode For?

- Experienced players who want a challenge
- Score chasers who want bragging rights
- Masochists

## Recommendation

If you're new to the game, **keep Deadly Mode off**. Master the normal mode first. Then, when songs feel too easy, turn on Deadly Mode for the ultimate challenge.

---

# Winning - The Victory Screen

You survived! The song is over and you still have health! Here's what you see on the **Victory Screen**:

# Tips For Survival

Now that you know everything about the game, here are some tips to help you survive:

## 1. Stay Near the Center

Don't hug the edges of the screen. You'll get cornered. Staying central gives you the most escape options.

## 2. Keep Moving

A moving target is harder to hit. Even when things seem calm, keep making small movements.

## 3. Watch the Whole Screen

Don't focus only on your character. Learn to see projectiles coming from all directions with peripheral vision.

## 4. Learn the Music

Projectiles are synced to the song. If you know a drop is coming, prepare for intense attacks. Quiet sections mean brief respites.

## 5. Don't Chase Score Early On

Focus on survival first. High combos and grazes come naturally once you're comfortable with movement.

## 6. Practice With Calm Songs First

Upload a mellow song for your first custom game. Intense EDM or metal will destroy you until you've practiced.

## 7. Use the Tutorial

Seriously. It's only 60 seconds and it's gentle. Start there.

## 8. Learn Projectile Patterns

Each projectile type has predictable behavior. Once you recognize them, dodging becomes instinctive.

## 9. Breathe

It's easy to tense up. Relax your hands. Breathe. Tension leads to jerky movements and mistakes.

## 10. Have Fun

It's a game. You're going to die. A lot. That's okay. Each run teaches you something.
